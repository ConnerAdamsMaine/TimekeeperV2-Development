# TimekeeperV2
**TimekeeperV2** is a developer-focused Discord bot built with `discord.py`.  
It serves as a spiritual successor to the original **Timekeeper** bot (EOLâ€™d in 2025) and is designed for businesses, RP servers, and larger communities where members may be required to track or log time.  

This repository is intended for **developers and contributors** who want to run their own instance or build on top of the bot. End-user documentation is available separately.


## Features
- Clock-in and elapsed time tracking  
- Periodic reminders (default: every 30 minutes, configurable)  
- Designed for multi-server use as a single closed-loop instance  
- Extensible structure for long-term development and contributions  


## Project Structure
All source code is contained within the `src/` directory, divided into:  

- **Core/** â€“ core logic and runtime  
- **Commands/** â€“ slash command handlers  
- **Data/** â€“ storage and persistence logic  
- **Utils/** â€“ helper functions and utilities  
- (additional directories may be added as development continues)

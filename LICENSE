Preamble
This software is provided AS IS.
There is no warranty, no guarantee of functionality, no promise of privacy, and no expectation of support.
If you use this software, you do so entirely at your own risk.

1. No Warranty or Liability
- This project comes with absolutely no warranty.
- The authors and contributors are not responsible or liable for any issues, damages, or losses of any kind.
- If the software breaks, that is your problem.
- If it somehow breaks your system, you have probably done something catastrophic — because Python by itself really cannot do that.

2. Data and Privacy
- This software logs data to an external API and to internal log files.
- By using it, you accept that this happens and assume all associated risks.
- There is no expectation of privacy when running this software.

3. Usage Restrictions
- Do not request support, fixes, or new features from the authors.
- Do not attempt to resell this project or any derivative.
- Do not claim this project as your own.

4. Contributions
- You may fork and modify this project.
- If you make a groundbreaking change, credit will be acknowledged.
- Unless your changes fundamentally alter the project into something entirely new, the code remains under the ownership of the original authors.

5. Summary
This license boils down to:
- No liability: If it breaks, it’s your problem.
- No ownership transfer: You can’t claim this as yours.
- No reselling: You can’t profit from this.
- Contribution is welcome: But the project is still ours unless you truly reinvent it.
